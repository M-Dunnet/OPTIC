# OPTIC Config file
# This config file provides OPTIC with the information it needs to analyse mutation annotation format files
# Each configuration  is on its own line, with the configuration name and value separated by a tab. A description of each option is listed above
# Do not change the configuration name or OPTIC won't know what it is.
# All column numbers are using 0-based indexing, i.e. first column is column 0
# Some configurations are optional. If you wish to exclude them, add a hash (#) at the beginning of the line.
